A fellow student and I worked on creating glasses that could translate language on the fly. We entered a competition (Brilliant Catalyst) to get funding for our idea. We performed market validation to address interest or lack thereof. We also created a slide deck for the competition. Our team used the open-sourced [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to create text from images, then we used Google Translate's API to translate this text from one language to another, and we finally used the open-sourced [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool) to check for grammmar and spelling.
